# Machine Learning Assignment Two

### Class - CSC 2850 - Georgia State University
### Name - John Ericson
### Date - 02/23/23


## Overview
This assignment covers the usage of 3 different machine learning classifiers:

1. Perceptron
2. Decision Tree
3. Logistic Regression

These classifiers come from the python module sklearn. 

## Results

As you can see the Logistic Regression model preformed the best out of the three, with the Perceptron surprisingly having a higher accuracy than the Decision Tree model.
